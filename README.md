# Knapsack Problem

This is a simple implementation of the Knapsack problem using JavaScript.

## Description

The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

This implementation allows the user to set the weight of the knapsack, select items from a dropdown list, add them to the knapsack, and calculate the total weight and value of the selected items.

## Usage

1. Enter the weight of the knapsack in the input field labeled "Weight Of Knapsack" and click the "Set weight" button.
2. Select items from the dropdown list labeled "Select Items" and click the "Add To List" button to add them to the knapsack.
3. Once you have added all desired items, click the "Done" button to calculate the total weight and value of the selected items.
4. If you want to start over, click the "Refill" button to clear the knapsack and start again.
